RAR::Unrar is a procedural module that provides manipulation (extraction and listing of embedded information) of compressed RAR format archives by interfacing with the unrar.dll dynamic library for Windows.

It uses two functions : list_files_in_archive and process file

The first one lists details embedded into the archive (files bundled into the .rar archive,archive's comments and header info) and the latter extracts the files from the archive.

Both procedures return undef if successfull, and an error description if something went wrong
	$result=process_file($file,$password); 
	print "There was an error : $result" if defined($result);
	
sample usage :

	list_files_in_archive($file,$password); 
	process_file($file,$password); 
	
	#if RAR archive in the same directory as caller
	list_files_in_archive("myfile.rar","mypassword");
    process_file("myfile.rar","mypassword"); 
	
	#absolute path if RAR archive not in the same directory as the caller
	list_files_in_archive("c:\mydirectory\myfile.rar","mypassword");
    process_file("c:\mydirectory\myfile.rar","mypassword"); 
	

Full documentation is available in POD format inside API.pm.
